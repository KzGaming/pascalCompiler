	Project #3 - Semantic Analyzer and Code generation
	Student: Fl√°vio Heleno Batista
	Number: 5890027

HOW TO
	To run this project, make sure you have PHP5+ CLI installed.
	On debian-like distributions you can install by running 'sudo apt-get install php5-cli' into a shell.
	To make sure you have PHP5+ CLI installed, run into a shell 'php --version', the result should be like this: PHP 5.3.2-1ubuntu3 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Mar 29 2010 12:23:29).
	After that, you can run the script 'run-me.sh', passing as argument the option 'e' and the source file path.
	e.g.: ./run-me.sh e my_source_file.txt (for a file in the same folder as the program)
	e.g.: ./run-me.sh e /home/user/my_source_file.txt (for an absolute path)
